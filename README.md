# EnEff-BIM use cases
This repository contains the use cases that we use to test our toolchain.  
This repository uses submodules, so you have to use the switch `--recursive` when cloning it:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:EnEff-BIM/EnEffBIM_UseCases.git
```

The above command uses the git over ssh protocol (and not https!),
so you will have to authenticate using ssh keys:
